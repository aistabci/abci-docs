# Remote desktop

## Overview

This chapter describes using Remote Desktop. By using Remote Desktop, you can use the GUI on compute nodes.

## Preparation

* login the interactive node and launch vncserver for initial settings 

```

[abciuser@esX ~] $ vncserver

You will require a password to access your desktops.

Password:

Verify:

Would you like to enter a view-only password (y/n)? n

New 'esX.abci.local:1 (abciuser)' desktop is esX.abci.local:1

Creating default startup script /home/abciuser/.vnc/xstartup

Creating default config /home/abciuser/.vnc/config

Starting applications specified in /home/abciuser/.vnc/xstartup

Log file is /home/abciuser/.vnc/esX.abci.local:1.log

```

* stop VNC server

```

[user@gXXXX ~] vncserver -kill :1

```

* edit some configuration files.

$HOME/.vnc/xstartup:

```

#!/bin/sh

unset SESSION_MANAGER

unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS

xrdb $HOME/.Xresources

startxfce4 &

```

you can change screen size to edit $HOME/.vnc/config as needed.

```

geometry=2000x1200

```

* login to ABCI and 

```

[user@localmachine] $ ssh -J %r@as.abci.ai abciuser@es

```

* login to a compute node which is assigned by UGE with ABCI On-demand service and resource type rt_F.

```
[abciuser@esX ~] $ qrsh -g abcigroup -l rt_F=1

```

* launch vncserver

```

[user@gXXXX ~] vncserver

New 'gXXXX.abci.local:1 (abciuser)' desktop is gXXXX.abci.local:1

Starting applications specified in /home/abciuser/.vnc/xstartup

Log file is /home/abciuser/.vnc/gXXXX.abci.local:1.log

```

gXXXX.abci.local:1 is a display name of launched VNC server.A port number 5901 is assinged to this server. A port with 5900 added to the display number is allocated such as: 5902 in case of :2, 5903 in case of :3.


## Start VNC

The following chapter explains how to start VNC separately for macOS and Windows.

### macOS environment

In macOS, OpenSSH 7.4 or later is installed by default, and the VNC client is integrated in the Finder.

* Configure port forwarding from the local machine.

```

[user@localmachine] $ ssh -N -L 5901:XXX.abci.local:5901 -J %r@as.abci.ai abciuser@es

```

By accessing 5901 on the local machine, you can connect to the VNC server.

* launch VNC client

```

[user@localmachine] $ open vnc://localhost:5901/

```

### Windows environment

Configure port forwarding.

*   PuTTY

    Click [Change Settings...] and click [SSH] - [Tunnels].

	| local port | port number which you can use on your system. ex) 15901 |
	| remote host:port | hostname of compute node and port number of VNC server ex) g0123:5901) |

    Launch VNC client and connect to localhost and the port number which assigned by SSH port forwarding.
    In the example of Tiger VNC client, hostname and port number are connected by "::".

<div align="center">
<img src="/img/apdx2_vnc_viewer_01.png" width="480" title="vncviewer"><br>
</div>

Click [Accept] , enter your VNC password, then launch VNC viewer.

## Stop VNC

* stop VNC service and exit compute node.

```

[user@gXXXX ~]$ vncserver -list

TigerVNC server sessions:

X DISPLAY #     PROCESS ID
:1              5081

[user@gXXXX ~] vncserver -kill :1

[user@gXXXX ~] exit

[user@esX ~] exit

```
