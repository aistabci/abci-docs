# 3. Job Execution Environment

## 3.1. Job Service Menu

The following job services are available in the ABCI System.

| Service name | Description | Service charge coefficient | Job style |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Spot | Job service of batch execution | 1.0 | Batch |
| On-demand | Job service of interactive execution | 1.0 | Interactive |
| Reserved | Job service of reservation | 1.5 | Batch/Interactive |

In the case of Spot service and On-demand service, when starting a job, the ABCI point scheduled
for job is calculated by limited value of elapsed time, and subtract processing is executed.
When a job finishes, the ABCI point is calculated again by actual elapsed time, and repayment process is executed.
In the case of Reserved service, when completing a reservation, the ABCI point is calculated by
a period of reservation, end subtract processing is executed.
The repayment process is not executed unless reservation is cancelled.

## 3.2. Job Executing Resource

The ABCI System allocates system resources to jobs using resource type that means logical partition of compute nodes.
To submit or execute a job, specify the following resource type name.

| Resource type | Resource type name | Description | Assigned physical CPU core | Number of assigned GPU | Memory(GiB) | Local storage(GB) | Resource type charge coefficient |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Full | rt_F | node-exclusive | 40 | 4 | 360 | 1440 | 1.00 |
| G.large | rt_G.large | node-sharing<br>with GPU | 20 | 4 | 240 | 720 | 0.90 |
| G.small | rt_G.small | node-sharing<br>with GPU | 5 | 1 | 60 | 180 | 0.30 |
| C.large | rt_C.large | node-sharing<br>CPU only | 20 | 0 | 120 | 720 | 0.60 |
| C.small | rt_C.small | node-sharing<br>CPU only | 5 | 0 | 30 | 180 | 0.20 |

When you execute a job using multiple nodes, you need to specify resource type `rt_F` for node-exclusive.

!!! warning
    On node-sharing job, the job process information can be seen from other jobs executed on the same nodes. If you want to hide your job process information, specify resource type rt_F and execute a node-exclusive job.

The available resource type and number for each service are as follows.

| Service | Resource type name | Range of number |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Spot | rt_F | 1-512 |
|      | rt_G.large | 1 |
|      | rt_G.small | 1 |
|      | rt_C.large | 1 |
|      | rt_C.small | 1 |
| On-demand | rt_F       | 1-32 |
|           | rt_G.large | 1 |
|           | rt_G.small | 1 |
|           | rt_C.large | 1 |
|           | rt_C.small | 1 |
| Reserved  | rt_F       | 1-number of reserved nodes |
|           | rt_G.large | 1 |
|           | rt_G.small | 1 |
|           | rt_C.large | 1 |
|           | rt_C.small | 1 |

The job limit of elapsed time for each service are as follows.

| Service | Resource type name | Limit of elapsed time (upper limit/default) |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Spot | rt_F | 72:00:00/1:00:00 |
|      | rt_G.large, rt_C.large | 72:00:00/1:00:00 |
|      | rt_G.small, rt_C.small | 168:00:00/1:00:00 |
| On-demand | rt_F | 12:00:00/1:00:00 |
|      | rt_G.large, rt_C.large | 12:00:00/1:00:00 |
|      | rt_G.small, rt_C.small | 12:00:00/1:00:00 |
| Reserved | rt_F | unlimited |
|      | rt_G.large, rt_C.large | unlimited |
|      | rt_G.small, rt_C.small | unlimited |

In case of Spot or On-demand service, the job cannot be executed over the node-hour restriction bellow.

| Service | max value of node-hour |
|:--|:--|
| Spot | 2304 nodes &middot; hours |
| On-demand | 12 nodes &middot; hours |

In the case of Spot service, the job can be executed with priority, by specifying the POSIX priority.

| Service | Description | POSIX priority | POSIX priority coefficient |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Spot | default | -500 | 1.0 |
|      | priority | -400 | 1.5 |


The calculation formula of ABCI point using for Spot service and On-demand service is as follows.

```
Using ABCI point = Service charge coefficient x Resource type charge coefficient 
                  x Number of resource type x POSIX priority charge coefficient
                  x max(Elapsed time[sec], Minimum Elapsed time) / 3600
```

!!! note
    * The five and under decimal places is rounding off.
    * If elapsed time of job executing is less than minimum elapsed time, ABCI point calculated based on minimum elapsed time.

The calculation formula of ABCI point using for Reserved service is follows.

```
Using ABCI point = Service charge coefficient x number of reserved nodes 
                  x number of reserved days x 24
```

## 3.3. Job Executing Option

To execute a job in batch mode, use the `qsub` command.
To execute a job in interactive mode, use the `qrsh` command.

The major options of the `qsub` and the `qrsh` command are follows.

| Option | Description |
|:--|:--|
| -g *group* | Specify ABCI user group |
| -l *resource_type*=*number* | Specify resource type (mandatory) |

| -t *start*[*-end*[*:step*]] | Specify task ID of array job. suboption is *start_number*[-*end_number*[*:step_size*]] |
| -hold_jid *job_id* | Specify job ID having dependency. the submitted job is not executed until dependent job finished. |
| -ar *ar_id* | Specify reserved ID (AR-ID), when using reserved compute node |

## 3.4. Interactive Job

To execute an interactive job, use the `qrsh` command.
If ABCI point is insufficient when executing interactive job, execution is failed.

```
$ qrsh -g ABCI_UserGroup -l Resource_type=number [option]

```

Example) Executing Interactive job

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qrsh -g grpname -l rt_F=1
[username@g0001 ~]$ 
```

To execute an application using X-Window, you need to login with the X forwading option as follows.

```
yourpc$ ssh -XC -p 10022 -l username localhost  <- specifye -X or -Y option
```

To execute a interactive job, specify the `-pty yes -display $DISPLAY -v TERM /bin/bash`.

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qrsh -g grpname -l rt_F=1 -pty yes -display $DISPLAY -v TERM /bin/bash
[username@g0001 ~]$ xterm <- execute X application

```

## 3.5. Batch Job

To run a batch job on the ABCI System, you need to make a job script in addition to execution program.
The job script is described job execute option, such as resource type, elapsed time limit, etc., and executing command sequence.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#$ -l rt_F=1
#$ -l h_rt=1:23:45
#$ -j y
#$ -cwd

[Initialization of Environment Modules]
[Setting of Environment Modules]
[Executing program]
```

Example) Sample job script executing program with CUDA

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#$-l rt_F=1
#$-j y
#$-cwd

source /etc/profile.d/modules.sh
module load cuda/9.2/9.2.88.1
./a.out
```

### 3.5.1. Submission of Batch Job


To submit a batch job, use the `qsub` command.
If ABCI point is insufficient when submitting batch job, submission is failed.

```
$ qsub -g ABCI_UserGroup [option] job_script
```

Example) Submission job script run.sh as a batch job

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qsub -g grpname run.sh
Your job 12345 ("run.sh") has been submitted
```

!!! warning
    The `-g` option cannot specify in job script.

### 3.5.2. Reference of batch job

```

### 3.5.4. Standard Output and Standard Error Output of Batch Job

Standard output file and standard error output file are written to job submission directory, or to files specified at job submission.
Standard output generated during a job execution is written to a standard output file and error messages generated during the
job execution to a standard error output file if no standard output and standard err output files are specified at job submission,
the following files are generated for output.

- Jobname.o.JobID  ---  Standard output file

    Making reservation of compute node is permitted to a responsible person or a manager.

To make a reservation compute node, use `qrsub` command or the ABCI User Portal .

```
$ qrsub options
```

| Option | Description |
|:--|:--|
| -a *YYYYMMDD* | Specify start reservation date(format: YYYYMMDD) |

To cancel a reservation, use the `qrdel` command or the ABCI User Portal.

Example) Cancel a reservation

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qrdel 12345
```
