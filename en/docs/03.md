# 3. Job Execution Environment

## Job Services

The following job services are available in the ABCI System.

| Service name | Description | Service charge coefficient | Job style |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| On-demand | Job service of interactive execution | 1.0 | Interactive |
| Spot | Job service of batch execution | 1.0 | Batch |
| Reserved | Job service of reservation | 1.5 | Batch/Interactive |

For the job execution resources available for each job service and the restrictions, see [Job Execution Resources](#job-execution-resource). Also, for accounting, see [Accounting](#accounting).

### On-demand Service

On-demand service is an interactive job execution service suitable for compiling and debugging programs, interactive applications, and running visualization software.

See [Interactive Jobs](#interactive-jobs) for usage, and [Job Execution Options](#job-execution-options) for details on interactive job execution options.

### Spot Service

Spot Service is a batch job execution service suitable for executing applications that do not require interactive processing. It is possible to execute jobs that take longer or have a higher degree of parallelism than On-demand service.

See [Batch Jobs](#batch-jobs) for usage, and [Job Execution Options](#job-execution-options) for details on batch job execution options.

### Reserved Service

Reserved service is a service that allows you to reserve and use computational resources on a daily basis in advance. It allows planned job execution without being affected by the congenstions of On-demand and Spot services. In addition, since there are no restrictions on elapsed time and node-time product, it is possible to execute jobs for a longer period of time.

In Reserved service, you first make a reservation in advance to obtain a reservation ID (AR-ID), and then use this reservation ID to execute interactive jobs and batch jobs.

See [Advance Reservation](#advance-reservation) for the reservation method. The usage and execution options for interactive jobs and batch jobs are the same as for On-demand and Spot services.

## Job Execution Resource

The ABCI System allocates system resources to jobs using resource type that means logical partition of compute nodes.
When using any of the On-demand, Spot, and Reserved services, you need to specify the resource type and its quantity that you want to use, submit or execute jobs, and reserves compute nodes.

The following describes the available resource types first, followed by the restrictions on the amount of resources available at the same time, elapsed time and node-time product, job submissions and executions, and so on.

### Available Resource Types

The ABCI system has two types of computational resources, [compute node](01.md#compute-node) and [memory-intensive node](01.md#memory-intensive-node), each of which has the following resource types:

#### Compute Node

| Resource type | Resource type name | Description | Assigned physical CPU core | Number of assigned GPU | Memory (GiB) | Local storage (GB) | Resource type charge coefficient |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Full | rt\_F | node-exclusive | 40 | 4 | 360 | 1440 | 1.00 |
| G.large | rt\_G.large | node-sharing<br>with GPU | 20 | 4 | 240 | 720 | 0.90 |
| G.small | rt\_G.small | node-sharing<br>with GPU | 5 | 1 | 60 | 180 | 0.30 |
| C.large | rt\_C.large | node-sharing<br>CPU only | 20 | 0 | 120 | 720 | 0.60 |
| C.small | rt\_C.small | node-sharing<br>CPU only | 5 | 0 | 30 | 180 | 0.20 |

#### Memory-intensive Node

| Resource type | Resource type name | Description | Assigned physical CPU core | Number of assigned GPU | Memory (GiB) | Local storage (GB) | Resource type charge coefficient |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| M.large | rt\_M.large | node-sharing<br>CPU only | 8 | \- | 800 | 480 | 0.40 |
| M.small | rt\_M.small | node-sharing<br>CPU only | 4 | \- | 400 | 240 | 0.20 |

When you execute a job using multiple nodes, you need to specify resource type `rt_F` for node-exclusive. The memory-intensive node is not available for using multiple nodes.

!!! warning
    On node-sharing job, the job process information can be seen from other jobs executed on the same nodes. If you want to hide your job process information, specify resource type `rt_F` and execute a node-exclusive job.

### Number of nodes available at the same time

The available resource type and number of nodes for each service are as follows. When you execute a job using multiple nodes, you need to specify resource type `rt_F`.

| Service | Resource type name | Number of nodes |
|:--|:--|--:|
| On-demand | rt\_F       | 1–32 |
|           | rt\_G.large | 1 |
|           | rt\_G.small | 1 |
|           | rt\_C.large | 1 |
|           | rt\_C.small | 1 |
|           | rt\_M.large | 1 |
|           | rt\_M.small | 1 |
| Spot      | rt\_F       | 1–512 |
|           | rt\_G.large | 1 |
|           | rt\_G.small | 1 |
|           | rt\_C.large | 1 |
|           | rt\_C.small | 1 |
|           | rt\_M.large | 1 |
|           | rt\_M.small | 1 |
| Reserved  | rt\_F       | 1–(number of reserved nodes) |
|           | rt\_G.large | 1 |
|           | rt\_G.small | 1 |
|           | rt\_C.large | 1 |
|           | rt\_C.small | 1 |

### Elapsed time and node-time product limits

There is an elapsed time limit (executable time limit) for jobs depending on the job service and resource type. The upper limit and default values are shown below.

| Service | Resource type name | Limit of elapsed time (upper limit/default) |
|:--|:--|:--|
| On-demand | rt\_F | 12:00:00/1:00:00 |
|           | rt\_G.large, rt\_C.large, rt\_M.large | 12:00:00/1:00:00 |
|           | rt\_G.small, rt\_C.small, rt\_M.small | 12:00:00/1:00:00 |
| Spot      | rt\_F | 72:00:00/1:00:00 |
|           | rt\_G.large, rt\_C.large, rt\_M.large, rt\_M.small | 72:00:00/1:00:00 |
|           | rt\_G.small, rt\_C.small | 168:00:00/1:00:00 |
| Reserved  | rt\_F | unlimited |
|           | rt\_G.large, rt\_C.large | unlimited |
|           | rt\_G.small, rt\_C.small | unlimited |

In addition, when executing a job that uses multiple nodes in On-demand or Spot services, there are the following restrictions on the node-time product (execution time &times; number of used nodes).

| Service | max value of node-hour |
|:--|--:|
| On-demand |   12 nodes &middot; hours |
| Spot      | 2304 nodes &middot; hours |

### Limitation on the number of job submissions and executions

The job limit of submission and execution for the job service are as follows. 
The number of the submitted jobs to the reserved node is included in the number of unfinished/running jobs as well as other On-demand/Spot jobs and are affected by the limit.

| Limitations                                                       | Limits  |
| :--                                                               | :--     |
| The maximum number of tasks within an array job                   | 75000   |
| The maximum number of any user's unfinished jobs at the same time | 1000    |
| The maximum number of any user's running jobs at the same time    | 200     |

### Execution Priority {#execution-priority}

Each job service allows you to specify a priority when running a job, as follows:

| Service | Description | POSIX priority | POSIX priority coefficient |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| On-demand | -450 | default (unchangable) | 1.0 |
| Spot      | -500 | default               | 1.0 |
|           | -400 | high priority         | 1.5 |
| Reserved  | -500 | default (unchangable) | NA  |

In On-demand service, the priority is fixed at `-450` and cannot be changed.

In Spot service, you can specify `-400` to your job, so as to execute it in higher priority to other jobs. However, you will be charged according to the POSIX priority coefficient.

In Reserved service, the priority is fixed at `-500` and cannot be changed for both interactive and batch jobs.

## Job Execution Options

Use `qrsh` command to run interactive jobs and the `qsub` command to run batch jobs.

The major options of the `qrsh` and the `qsub` commands are follows.

| Option | Description |
|:--|:--|
| -g *group* | Specify ABCI user group |
| -l *resource_type*=*number* | Specify resource type (mandatory) |
| -l h\_rt=[*HH:MM:*]*SS* | Specify elapsed time by [*HH:MM:*]*SS*. When execution time of job exceed specified time, job is rejected. |
| -N *name* | Specify job name. default is name of job script. |
| -o *stdout_name* | Specify standard output stream of job |
| -p *priority* | Specify POSIX priority for Spot service |
| -e *stderr_name* | Specify standard error stream of job |
| -j y | Specify standard error stream is merged into standard output stream |
| -m a | Mail is sent when job is aborted |
| -m b | Mail is sent when job is started |
| -m e | Mail is sent when job is finished |
| -t *start*[*-end*[*:step*]] | Specify task ID of array job. The suboption is *start_number*[-*end_number*[*:step_size*]] |
| -hold\_jid *job_id* | Specify job ID having dependency. The submitted job is not executed until dependent job finished. When this option is used by `qrsh` command, the command must be specified as an argument. |
| -ar *ar_id* | Specify reserved ID (AR-ID), when using reserved compute node |

In addition, the following options can be used as extended options:

| Option | Description |
|:--|:--|
| -l USE\_SSH=*1*<br>-v SSH\_PORT=*port* | Enable SSH login to the compute nodes. See [SSH Access to Compute Nodes](appendix/ssh-access.md) for details. |
| -l USE\_BEEOND=*1*<br>-v BEEOND\_METADATA\_SERVER=*num*<br>-v BEEOND\_STORAGE\_SERVER=*num* | Submit a job with using BeeGFS On Demand (BeeOND). See [Using as a BeeOND storage](04.md#using-as-a-beeond-storage) for details. |

| -l docker<br>-l docker\_images | Submit a job with a Docker container. See [Docker](09.md#docker) for details. |

## Interactive Jobs

To run an interactive job, use the `qrsh` command.

```
$ qrsh -g group -l resource_type=number [option]
```

Example) Executing an interactive job (On-demand service)

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qrsh -g grpname -l rt_F=1 -l h_rt=1:00:00
[username@g0001 ~]$ 
```

!!! note
    If ABCI point is insufficient when executing an interactive job with On-demand service, the execution is failed.

To execute an application using X-Window, first you need to login with the X forwading option (-X or -Y option) as follows:

```
[yourpc ~]$ ssh -XC -p 10022 -l username localhost
```

After that, run an interactive job with specifying `-pty yes -display $DISPLAY -v TERM /bin/bash`:

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qrsh -g grpname -l rt_F=1 -l h_rt=1:00:00 -pty yes -display $DISPLAY -v TERM /bin/bash
[username@g0001 ~]$ xterm <- execute X application
```

## Batch Jobs

To run a batch job on the ABCI System, you need to make a job script in addition to execution program.
The job script is described job execute option, such as resource type, elapsed time limit, etc., and executing command sequence.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#$ -l rt_F=1
#$ -l h_rt=1:23:45
#$ -j y
#$ -cwd

[Initialization of Environment Modules]
[Setting of Environment Modules]
[Executing program]
```

Example) Sample job script executing program with CUDA

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#$-l rt_F=1
#$-j y
#$-cwd

source /etc/profile.d/modules.sh
module load cuda/9.2/9.2.88.1
./a.out
```

### Submit a batch job

To submit a batch job, use the `qsub` command.

```
$ qsub -g group [option] job_script
```

Example) Submission job script run.sh as a batch job (Spot service)

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qsub -g grpname run.sh
Your job 12345 ("run.sh") has been submitted
```

!!! warning
    The `-g` option cannot specify in job script.

!!! note
    If ABCI point is insufficient when executing a batch job with Spot service, the execution is failed.

### Show the status of batch jobs

To show the current status of batch jobs, use the `qstat` command.

[username@es1 ~]$ qdel 12345
username has registered the job 12345 for deletion
```

### Stdout and Stderr of Batch Jobs

Standard output file and standard error output file are written to job execution directory, or to files specified at job submission.
Standard output generated during a job execution is written to a standard output file and error messages generated during the
job execution to a standard error output file if no standard output and standard err output files are specified at job submission,
the following files are generated for output.

- *JOB_NAME*.o*JOB_ID*  ---  Standard output file

## Advance Reservation

In the case of Reserved service, job execution can be scheduled by reserving compute node in advance.

The maximum number of nodes and the node-time product that can be reserved for this service is "Maximum reserved nodes per reservation" and "Maximum reserved node time per reservtation" in the following table. In addition, in this service, the user can only execute jobs with the maximum number of reserved nodes (Up to 32 nodes). Note that there is an upper limit on "Maximum number of nodes can be reserved at once per system" for the entire system, so you may only be able to make reservations that fall below "Maximum reserved nodes per reservation" or you may not be able to make reservations. [Each resource types](#available-resource-types) are available for reserved compute nodes.

| Item | Description |
|:--|:--|
| Minimum reservation days | 1 day |
| Maximum reservation days | 30 days |
| Maximum number of nodes can be reserved at once per system | 442 nodes |
| Maximum reserved nodes per reservation | 32 nodes |
| Maximum reserved node time per reservtation | 12,288 node x hour |
| Start time of accept reservation | 10:00 a.m. of 30 days ago |
| Closing time of accept reservation | 9:00 p.m. of Start reservation of the day before |
| Canceling reservation accept term | 9:00 p.m. of Start reservation of the day before |
| Reservation start time | 10:00 a.m. of Reservation start day |
| Reservation end time | 9:30 a.m. of Reservation end day |

### Make a reservation

!!! warning
    Making reservation of compute node is permitted to a responsible person or a manager.

To make a reservation compute node, use `qrsub` command or the ABCI User Portal .

```
$ qrsub options
```

| Option | Description |
|:--|:--|
| -a *YYYYMMDD* | Specify start reservation date (format: YYYYMMDD) |
| -d *days* | Specify reservation day. exclusive with -e option |
| -e *YYYYMMDD* | Specify end reservation date (format: YYYYMMDD). exclusive with -d option |
| -g *group* | Specify ABCI UserGroup |
| -N *name* | Specify reservation name. The reservation name can be alphanumeric and special characters `=+-_.`. The maximum length is 64 characters. However, the first letter must not be a number. |
| -n *nnode* | Specify the number of nodes. |

Example) Make a reservation 4 compute nodes from 2018/07/05 to 1 week (7 days)

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qrsub -a 20180705 -d 7 -g gxa50001 -n 4 -N "Reserve_for_AI"
Your advance reservation 12345 has been granted
```

The ABCI points are consumed when complete reservation.

### Show the status of reservations

To show the current status of reservations, use the `qrstat` command or the ABCI User Portal.

Example)

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qrstat
ar-id      name       owner        state start at             end at               duration    sr
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     12345 Reserve_fo root         w     07/05/2018 10:00:00  07/12/2018 09:30:00  167:30:00    false
```

| Field | Description |
|:-|:-|
| ar-id | Reservation ID (AR-ID) |
| name | Reserve name |
| owner | `root` is always displayed |
| state | Status of reservation |
| start at | Start reservation date (start time is 10:00 a.m. at all time) |
| end at | End reservation date (end time is 9:30 a.m. at all time) |
| duration | Reservation term (hhh:mm:ss) |
| sr | `false` is always displayed |

If you want to show the number of nodes that can be reserved, you need to access User Portal, or use`qrstat` command with `--available` option.

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qrstat --available
06/27/2018  441
07/05/2018  432
07/06/2018  434
```

!!! note
    The no reservation day is not printed.

### Cancel a reservation

!!! warning
    Canceling reservation is permitted to a responsible person or a manager.

To cancel a reservation, use the `qrdel` command or the ABCI User Portal. When canceling reservation with qrdel command, multiple reservation IDs can be specified as comma separated list. If you specify a reservation ID that does not exist or a reservation ID that you do not have deletion permission for, an error occurs and any reservations are not canceled.

Example) Cancel a reservation

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qrdel 12345,12346
```

### How to use reserved node  

To run a job using reserved compute nodes, specify reservation ID with the `-ar` option.

Example) Execute an interactive job on compute node reserved with reservation ID `12345`.

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qrsh -g grpname -ar 12345 -l rt_F=1 -l h_rt=1:00:00
[username@g0001 ~]$ 
```

Example) Submit a batch job on compute node reserved with reservation ID `12345`.

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qsub -g grpname -ar 12345 run.sh
Your job 12345 ("run.sh") has been submitted
```

!!! note
    - You must specify ABCI group that you specified when making reservation.
    - The batch job can be submitted immediately after making reservation, until reservation start time.
    - The batch job submitted before resevation start time can be deleted with `qdel` command.
    - If a reservation is deleted before reservation start time, batch jobs submitted to the reservation will be deleted.
    - At reservation end time, running jobs are killed.

### Cautions for Using reserved node

Advance Reservation does not guarantee the health of the compute node for the duration. Some reserved compute nodes may become unavailable while they are in use. Please check the following points.

* To check the availability status of the reserved compute nodes, using the `qrstat -ar ar_id` command. 
* If some reserved compute nodes appear unavailable status the day before the reservation start date, consider canceling the reservation and making the reservation again. 
* For example, if the compute node becomes unavailable during the reservation period, please check [Contact](./contact.md) and contact <qa@abci.ai>.

!!! note
    - Reservation can be canceled by 9:00 p.m. of the day before the reservation starts.  
    - Reservation cannot make when there is no free compute node.  
    - Hardware failures are handled properly. Please refrain from inquiring about unavailability before the day before the reservation starts.  
    - Requests to change the number of reserved compute nodes or to extend the reservation period can not be accepted.

Example) g0001 is available, g0002 is unavailable
```
[username@es1 ~]$ qrsub -a 20180705 -d 7 -g grpname -n 2 -N "Reserve_for_AI" 
Your advance reservation 12345 has been granted
[username@es1 ~]$ qrstat -ar 12345

## Accounting

### On-demand and Spot Services

In On-demand and Spot services, when starting a job, the ABCI point scheduled
for job is calculated by limited value of elapsed time, and subtract processing is executed.
When a job finishes, the ABCI point is calculated again by actual elapsed time, and repayment process is executed.

The calculation formula of ABCI point for using On-demand and Spot services is as follows:

> [Service charge coefficient](#job-services)  
> &times; [Resource type charge coefficient](#available-resource-types)  
> &times; [POSIX priority charge coefficient](#execution-priority)  
> &times; Number of resource type  
> &times; max(Elapsed time[sec], Minimum Elapsed time[sec])  
> &div; 3600

!!! note
    * The five and under decimal places is rounding off.
    * If the elapsed time of job execution is less than the minimum elapsed time, ABCI point calculated based on the minimum elapsed time.

### Reserved Service

In Reserved service, when completing a reservation, the ABCI point is calculated by
a period of reservation, end subtract processing is executed.
The repayment process is not executed unless reservation is cancelled.

The calculation formula of ABCI point for using Reserved service is follows:

> Service charge coefficient  
> &times; number of reserved nodes  
> &times; number of reserved days  
> &times; 24
