# Singularity Global Client

Singularity Global Client (``sregistry`` command) is software for managing images used in Singularity. It can also be used to get images from the registry.


## Usage {#usage}
The sregistry command can be used with ABCI by performing the following procedure in advance.

```
[username@es1 ~]$ module load singularitypro python/3.6/3.6.12 sregistry-cli
```

```
[username@es1 ~]$ sregistry --help
usage: sregistry [-h] [--debug] [--quiet] [--version]
                 {version,backend,shell,images,inspect,get,add,mv,rename,rm,search,build,push,share,pull,labels,delete}
                 ...

Singularity Global Client setting procedure and supported actions differ depending on the registry used.
For details, please refer to the page about the registry you want to use from [client tutorials](https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry-cli/clients){:target="sregistry-cli_clients"}.


## Example {#example}
As an execution example, the following shows the procedure for pull the latest-gpu tag image from ``myrepos/tensorflow`` repository on Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and saving it as a ``mytensorflow.simg`` file in the current directory.


!!! note
    This procedure assumes that you have completed [Register access token](/tips/awscli/#register-access-token){:target="aws_cli"} in [AWS CLI](/tips/awscli/){:target="aws_cli"}.


Load modules necessary for using Singularity Global Client and Amazon ECR.
```
[username@es1 ~]$ module load singularitypro python/3.6/3.6.12 sregistry-cli aws-cli
```


Set up to use Amazon ECR. Check ``<registryId>`` and ``<region>`` with ``aws ecr describe-repositories`` command and set each to environment variable.
```
[username@es1 ~]$ aws ecr describe-repositories --repository-name myrepos/tensorflow
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "repositoryArn": "arn:aws:ecr:<region>:<registryId>:repository/myrepos/tensorflow",
            "registryId": "<registryId>",
            "repositoryName": "myrepos/tensorflow",
            "repositoryUri": "<registryId>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/myrepos/tensorflow",
            "createdAt": 1572261978.0,
            "imageTagMutability": "MUTABLE"
        }
    ]
}
[username@es1 ~]$ export SREGISTRY_AWS_ID=<registryId>
[username@es1 ~]$ export SREGISTRY_AWS_ZONE=<region>
```

Get the image and save it as a ``mytensorflow.simg`` file. From the next time, you only need to load the module.
```
[username@es1 ~]$ sregistry pull --name mytensorflow.simg --no-cache aws://myrepos/tensorflow:latest-gpu
```

* The URI starting with ``aws://`` specifies the repository name tagged as follows.
  ```
aws://<repositoryName>:<imageTag>
  ```

Execute pulled image as interactive job.
```
[username@es1 ~]$ qrsh -g grpname -l rt_F=1 -l h_rt=1:00:00
[username@g0001 ~]$ module load singularitypro
[username@g0001 ~]$ singularity shell --nv ./mytensorflow.simg
