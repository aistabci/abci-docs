# 6. Use Python

# 6.1. Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is available on the ABCI System.

To show available Python versions with using `module` command:

```
$ module avail python

-------------------------------- /apps/modules/modulefiles/devtools --------------------------------
python/2.7/2.7.15 python/3.4/3.4.8  python/3.5/3.5.5  python/3.6/3.6.5
```

To set up one of available versions with using `module` command:

Example) Python 2.7.15:

```
$ module load python/2.7/2.7.15
$ python --version
Python 2.7.15
```

Example) Python 3.6.5:

```
$ module load python/3.6/3.6.5
$ python --version
Python 3.6.5
```

!!! note
    Users can install any python distributions (c.f., pyenv, conda) into their own home or group area. Please kindly note that such distributions are not eligible for the ABCI System support.

# 6.2. Python Virtual Environments

The ABCI System does not allow users to modify the system environment. Instead, it supports users to create Python virtual environments and install necessary modules into them.

On ABCI, `virtualenv` and `venv` modules provide support for creating lightweight “virtual environments” with their own site directories, optionally isolated from system site directories.
Each virtual environment has its own Python binary (which matches the version of the binary that was used to create this environment) and can have its own independent set of installed Python packages in its site directories.

Creating virtual environments, we use virtualenv for Python 2 and venv for Python 3, respectively.

# 6.1.1. virtualenv

Below are examples of executing `virtualenv`:

Example) Creation of a virtual environment

```
[username@es1 ~]$ module load python/2.7/2.7.15
[username@es1 ~]$ virtualenv hoo
New python executable in /fs3/home/username/work/bin/python2.7
Also creating executable in /fs3/home/username/work/bin/python
Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.
```

Example) Activating a virtual environment

```
[username@es1 ~]$ source work/bin/activate
(work) [username@es1 ~]$
(hoo) [username@es1 ~]$ which python
/fs3/home/username/work/bin/python
(hoo) [username@es1 ~]$ which pip
/fs3/home/username/work/bin/pip
```

Example) Installing numpy to a virtual environment

```
(work) [username@es1 ~]$ pip install numpy
```

Example) Deactivating a virtual environment

```
(work) [username@es1 ~]$ deactivate
[username@es1 ~]$
```

# 6.1.2. venv

Below are examples of executing `venv`:

Example) Creation of a virtual environment

```
[username@es1 ~]$ module load python/3.6/3.6.5
[username@es1 ~]$ python3 -m venv work
```

Example) Activating a virtual environment

```
[username@es1 ~]$ source work/bin/activate
(work) [username@es1 ~]$ which python3
/fs3/home/username/work/bin/python3
(work) [username@es1 ~]$ which pip3
/fs3/home/username/work/bin/pip3
```

Example) Installing numpy to a virtual environment

```
(work) [username@es1 ~]$ pip3 install numpy
```

Example) Deactivating a virtual environment

```
(work) [username@es1 ~]$ deactivate
[username@es1 ~]$
```

# 6.3. pip

The pip is a package management system for Python.
This `pip` command enables you to install Python package easily.

```
$ pip <sub-command>  [options]
```

| sub command | description |
|:--|:--|
| install *package* | install package |
| update *package* | update package |
| uninstall *package* | remove package |
| search *package* | search package |
| list | list installed packages |
