# 4. Storage

## 4.1. Object Stroage

The S3 compatible object storage area is available in ABCI System.
When you access to object storage area, you need access key and secret key.
The access key and secret key can be checked by using `get_object_storage_info` command
or accessing to the [ABCI User Portal](https://portal.abci.ai/user/).

Example) Checking access key and secret key by `get_object_storage_info` command

```
[username@es1 ~]$ get_object_storage_info
Access                             Secret                             Project_Name  User_Name
f5a6ae54ab154eaa9423b484cf89ec5f   eb445e4788e8c3279d4159180b14d9b7   projectname   username
```

For more information about checking via the [ABCI User Portal](https://portal.abci.ai/user/), Please refer to [ABCI User Portal Guide](https://portal.abci.ai/docs/portal/en/).

## 4.2. Local File System and BeeOND

In ABCI System, each compute node has NVMe Storage. The utilization method of this storage can be selected from two types as follows.

* Using as a local storage of each compute node.
* Using as a distributed shared file system of compute nodes.

### 4.2.1 Using as a local storage of each compute node.

The NVMe storage can be used as a local storage for each compute node.
In this case, user can access to local storage by using environment variables `SGE_LOCALDIR`.
When using this method, you need not to specify an additional option.

### 4.2.2 Using as a distributed shared file system of compute nodes.

The set of NVMe storages of job assigned compute nodes can be used as a
distributed shared file system (BeeGFS) on demand.
When using on demand BeeGFS (BeeOND), you need to submit job with `-l USE_BEEOND` option.
And you need to specify `-l rt_F` option in this case, because node must be exclusively allocated to job.

The created distributed shared file system area can be accessed from /beeond.

Example) sample of job script(use_beeond.sh)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#$-l rt_F=2
#$-l USE_BEEOND
#$-cwd

echo test1 > /beeond/foo.txt
echo test2 > /beeond/bar.txt
cp -rp /beeond/foo.txt $HOME/test/foo.txt
```

Example) Submitting a job

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qsub -g grpname use_beeond.sh
```

Example) Status after execution of use_beeond.sh

```
[username@es1 ~]$ ls $HOME/test/
foo.txt    <- The file remain only when it is copied explicitly in script.
```

!!! warning
    The file stored under `/beeond` directory is removed when job finished. The required file need to be moved to Home area or Group area in job script using `cp` command.
