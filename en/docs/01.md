# 1. ABCI System Overview

## 1.1. System Architecture

This system is AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure (ABCI).
The ABCI system consists of 1,088 compute nodes, large storage system which has 22PB disk space, high performance interconnect and software which makes the most of hardware.

The ABCI system provides total 16FP (half precision floating point) theoretical peak performance of 550PFLOPS and total 64FP (double precision floating point) theoretical peak performance of 37 PFLOPS. 
The total memory capacity is 476TiB, and total memory peak bandwidth is 4.19PB.

Each compute nodes and storage system are connected with InfiniBand EDR (100Gbps), and this system is connected to the Internet at speed of 100Gbps via SINET5.

## 1.5. System Use Overview

In the ABCI system, all compute nodes, interactive nodes share files through the parallel file system (DDN GRIDScaler).
All users can login to the interactive node as frontend with SSH tunneling.
After login to the interactive node, users can develop/compile/link a program, submit a job, display the status of the job and etc.
Users can develop a program for the compute node on the interactive node not equipped with GPUs.
To run a program on the compute nodes, users submit a batch job and an interactive job to job management system.
A interactive job is typically used for debugging a program, running an interactive application or a visualization application.

!!! warning
    Do not run high load tasks on the interactive node because computing resources such as CPU and memory of the interactive node are shared by many users. To run high load tasks for pre- & post-processing, use the compute nodes.
