# 4. Storage

## 4.1. Home Area {#home-area}

Home area is the disk area shared by each interactive and compute node, which is available to all ABCI users by default. The disk quota is limited to 200GiB.

### [Advanced Option] File Striping {#advanced-option-file-striping}

Home area is provided by the Lustre file system. The Lustre file system distributes and stores file data onto multiple disks. On home area, you can choose two distribution methods which are Round-Robin (default) and Striping.

#### How to Set Up File Striping {#how-to-set-up-file-striping}

```
$ lfs setstripe  [options] <dirname | filename>
```

| Option | Description |
|:--:|:---|
| -S | Sets a stripe size. -S #k, -S #m or -S #g option sets the size to KiB, MiB or GiB respectively. |
| -i | Specifies the start OST index to which a file is written. If -1 is set, the start OST is randomly selected. |
| -c | Sets a stripe count. If -1 is set, all available OSTs are written. |

!!! Tips
    To display  OST index, use the ```lfs df``` or ```lfs osts``` command

Example) Set a stripe pattern #1. (Creating a new file with a specific stripe pattern.)

```
[username@es1 work]$ lfs setstripe -S 1m -i 10 -c 4 stripe-file
[username@es1 work]$ ls
stripe-file
```

Example) Set a stripe pattern #2. (Setting up a stripe pattern to a directory.)

```
[username@es1 work]$ mkdir stripe-dir
[username@es1 work]$ lfs setstripe -S 1m -i 10 -c 4 stripe-dir
```

#### How to Display File Striping Settings {#how-to-display-file-striping-settings}

To display the stripe pattern of a specified file or directory, use the lfs getstripe command.

```
$ lfs getstripe <dirname | filename>
```

Example) Display stripe settings #1. (Displaying the stripe pattern of a file.)

```
[username@es1 work]$ lfs getstripe stripe-file
stripe-file
lmm_stripe_count:  4
lmm_stripe_size:   1048576
lmm_pattern:       1
lmm_layout_gen:    0
lmm_stripe_offset: 10
        obdidx           objid           objid           group
            10         3024641       0x2e2701                0
            11         3026034       0x2e2c72                0
            12         3021952       0x2e1c80                0
            13         3019616       0x2e1360                0
```

Example) Display stripe settings #2. (Displaying the stripe pattern of a directory.)

```
[username@es1 work]$ lfs getstripe stripe-dir
stripe-dir
stripe_count:  4 stripe_size:   1048576 stripe_offset: 10
```

## 4.2. Group Area {#group-area}

Group area is the disk area shared by each interactive and compute node.
To use Group area, "Usage Manager" of the group needs to apply "Add group disk" via [ABCI User Portal](https://portal.abci.ai/user/). Regarding how to add group disk, please refer to [Disk Addition Request](https://docs.abci.ai/portal/en/03/#352-disk-addition-request) in the [ABCI Portal Guide](https://docs.abci.ai/portal/en/).

## 4.3. Local Storage {#local-storage}

In ABCI System, 1.6 TB NVMe storage is installed into each compute node. There are two ways to utilize this storage as follows:

* Using as a local storage of each compute node (*Using as a local storage*).
* Using as a distributed shared file system, which consists of multiple NVMe storages in multiple compute nodes (*Using as a BeeOND storage*).

### 4.3.1. Using as a local storage {#using-as-a-local-storage}

The NVMe storage can be used as a local storage for each compute node.
In this case, user can access to local storage by using environment variables `SGE_LOCALDIR`.
When using this method, you need not to specify any additional options.

Note that the amount of the local storage you can use is determined by "Resource type". For more detail on "Resource type", please refer to [Job Executing Resource](03.md#job-executing-resource).

### 4.3.2. Using as a BeeOND storage {#using-as-a-beeond-storage}

The set of NVMe storages of job assigned compute nodes can be used as a
distributed shared file system (BeeGFS) on demand.
When using on demand BeeGFS (BeeOND), you need to submit job with `-l USE_BEEOND=1` option.
And you need to specify `-l rt_F` option in this case, because node must be exclusively allocated to job.

The created distributed shared file system area can be accessed from /beeond.

Example) sample of job script (use_beeond.sh)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#$-l rt_F=2
#$-l USE_BEEOND=1
#$-cwd

echo test1 > /beeond/foo.txt
echo test2 > /beeond/bar.txt
cp -rp /beeond/foo.txt $HOME/test/foo.txt
```

Example) Submitting a job

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qsub -g grpname use_beeond.sh
```

Example) Status after execution of use_beeond.sh

```
[username@es1 ~]$ ls $HOME/test/
foo.txt    <- The file remain only when it is copied explicitly in script.
```

!!! warning
    The file stored under `/beeond` directory is removed when job finished. The required files need to be moved to Home area or Group area in job script using `cp` command.

#### [Advanced Option] Configure BeeOND Servers {#advanced-beeond-option-servers}

A BeeOND filesystem partition consists of two kinds of services running on compute nodes: one is storage service which stores files, and the other is metadata service which stores file matadata.  Each service runs on compute nodes.  We refer to a compute node which runs storage service as a storage server and a compute node which runs metadata service as a metadata server.  Users can specify number of storage servers and metadata servers.

The default values for counts of metadata server and storage server are as follows.

| Parameter | Default |
|:--:|---:|
| Count of metadata servers | 1 |
| Count of storage servers | Number of nodes requested by a job |

To change the counts, define following environment variables.  These environment variables have to be defined at job submission, and changing in job script takes no effect.  When counts of servers are less than the number of requested nodes, servers are lexicographically selected by their names from assigned compute nodes.

| Environment Variable | Description |
|:---|:---|
| BEEOND_METADATA_SERVER | Count of metadata servers in integer |
| BEEOND_STORAGE_SERVER | Count of storage servers in integer |

The following example create a BeeOND partition with two metadata servers and four storage servers.  `beegfs-df` is used to see the configuration.

Example) sample of job script (use_beeond.sh)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#$-l rt_F=8
#$-l USE_BEEOND=1
#$-v BEEOND_METADATA_SERVER=2
#$-v BEEOND_STORAGE_SERVER=4
#$-cwd

beegfs-df -p /beeond
```

Example output
```
METADATA SERVERS:
TargetID   Cap. Pool        Total         Free    %      ITotal       IFree    %
========   =========        =====         ====    =      ======       =====    =

       2      normal    1489.7GiB    1322.7GiB  89%      149.0M      149.0M 100%

STORAGE TARGETS:

========   =========        =====         ====    =      ======       =====    =
       1      normal    1489.7GiB    1322.7GiB  89%      149.0M      149.0M 100%

       4      normal    1489.7GiB    1322.7GiB  89%      149.0M      149.0M 100%
```

#### [Advanced Option] File Striping {#advanced-beeond-option-file-striping}

Files are split into small chunks and stored in multiple storage servers in a BeeOND partition.  Users can change file striping configuration of BeeOND.

The default configuration of the file striping is as follows.

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|:--:|---:|:---|
| Stripe size | 512 KB | File chunk size |
| Stripe count | 4 | Number of storage servers that store chunks of a file |

Users can configure file striping per-file or per-directory using `beegfs-ctl` command.

The following example sets file striping configuration of `/beeond/data` directory as 8 stripe count and 4MB stripe size.

Example) sample of job script (use_beeond.sh)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#$-l rt_F=8
#$-l USE_BEEOND=1
#$-cwd

BEEOND_DIR=/beeond/data
mkdir ${BEEOND_DIR}
beegfs-ctl --setpattern --numtargets=8 --chunksize=4M --mount=/beeond ${BEEOND_DIR}
beegfs-ctl --mount=/beeond --getentryinfo ${BEEOND_DIR}
```

Output example

```
New chunksize: 4194304
New number of storage targets: 8

EntryID: 0-5D36F5EC-1
Metadata node: gXXXX.abci.local [ID: 1]
Stripe pattern details:
+ Type: RAID0
+ Chunksize: 4M
+ Number of storage targets: desired: 8
+ Storage Pool: 1 (Default)
```

## 4.4. Object Storage {#object-storage}

!!! warning "Caution"
    object storage service is currently unavailable.

The S3 compatible object storage area is available in ABCI System.
When you access to object storage area, you need access key and secret key.
