## 11.2. Big Data Analytics Framework

### 11.2.1 Hadoop

Hadoop is available for ABCI System. When you use this framework, you need to set up user environment by `module` command.

Setting commands for Hadoop are the following.

```
$ module load openjdk/1.8.0.131
$ module load hadoop/2.9.1
```

Example) Running Hadoop on compute nodes.

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qrsh -l rt_F=1
[username@g0001~]$ module load openjdk/1.8.0.131
[username@g0001~]$ module load hadoop/2.9.1
[username@g0001~]$ mkdir input
[username@g0001~]$ cp /apps/hadoop/2.9.1/etc/hadoop/*.xml input
[username@g0001~]$ hadoop jar /apps/hadoop/2.9.1/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.9.1.jar grep input output 'dfs[a-z.]+'
[username@g0001~]$ cat output/part-r-00000
1       dfsadmin
```
