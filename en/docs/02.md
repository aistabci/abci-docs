# 2. ABCI System User Environment

## 2.1. Get an Account

There are three types of ABCI users: "Responsible Person", "Usage Manager", "User".
To use the ABCI system, "Responsible Person" needs to register from the [ABCI User Portal](https://portal.abci.ai/user/project_regist_app.php) in advance.
For more detail, see the [ABCI Portal Guide](https://portal.abci.ai/docs/portal/en/).

!!! note
    - Account is also issued to "Responsible Person".
    - "Responsible Person" can change the "User" to "Usage Manager" using [ABCI User Portal](https://portal.abci.ai/user/).
    - "Responsible Person" and "Usage Manager" can add users("Usage Manager" or "User").

## 2.2. Login to Interactive Node

To login to the interactive node(*es*) as frontend, you need to register the SSH public key on the [ABCI User Portal](https://portal.abci.ai/user/) and to make an SSH portforwarding/tunneling logining to access server(*as.abci.ai*) with SSH public authentication.

### 2.2.1. Linux/Mac Environment

This section describes two ways to login the interactive node. The first way is standard method which is login to the interactive node after making an SSH portforwarding/tunneling in the access server. The other is to use ProxyJump which implemented in OpenSSH 7.3 or higher.

* Standard method

login to access server (*as.abci.ai*) with following command.

<pre>
yourpc$ ssh -L 10022:<i>es</i>:22 -l username <i>as.abci.ai</i>
The authenticity of host 'as.abci.ai (0.0.0.1)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX. <- Display only at the first login
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?  <-  Enter "yes"
Warning: Permanently added ‘XX.XX.XX.XX' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
Enter passphrase for key '/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa': <- Enter passphrase  
</pre>

When you login to the access server successfully, the following message is shown on your terminal.

```
Welcome to ABCI access server.
Please press any key if you disconnect this session.
```

!!! warning
    Be sure to SSH session will be disconnected if you press enter any key.

Launch another terminal and login to the interactive node using SSH tunnel.

```
yourpc$ ssh -p 10022 -l username localhost
The authenticity of host 'localhost (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX. <- Display only at the first login
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?  <-  Enter "yes"
Warning: Permanently added 'localhost' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
Enter passphrase for key '/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa': <- Enter passphrase
[username@es1 ~]$
```

* Use ProxyJump (OpenSSH 7.3 or higher)

To login the interactive node, execute the following command.

<pre>
 yourpc$ ssh -i identity_file -o "ProxyJump username@<i>as.abci.ai</i>" username@<i>es</i>  
</pre>
or  
<pre>    
 yourpc$ ssh -i identity_file -J username@<i>as.abci.ai</i> username@<i>es</i>
</pre>


### 2.2.2. Windows Environment（PuTTY）

This section describes how to use PuTTY for virtual terminal applications are available on Windows.
In order to login to the interactive node, the following procedure is necessary.

1. set up SSH tunnel with PuTTY
2. login to access server
3. login to the interactive node from another terminal


#### 2.2.2.1. SSH tunnel with PuTTY

*   Launch PuTTY, and set up SSH tunnel

    click [Connection] - [SSH] - [Tunnels] and enter following information.

	| item | value |
	|:--|:--|

	| local port |  ex)11022 |
	| remote host and port | *es.abci.local:22* or *es:22* ex) *es.abci.local:22*|
	| remote port | 22 |

*   click [Add]

<div align="center">
<img src="/img/02_login_putty_03.png" width="480" title="putty:add ssh tunnel" >
</div>

#### 2.2.3.2. login to access server

*  Specify a private key file
<a name="putty:ssh-auth-as"></a>

    Click  [Connection] - [SSH] - [Auth], and specify a private key file.

	| item | value |
	|:--|:--|
	| sample image | <img src="/img/02_login_putty_04.png"  width="480" title="putty:auth info" > |
	| private key file for authentication | path of your private key file |

*   Open session to access server with PuTTY
     
    Click [Session], enter following information

	| item | value |
	|:--|:--|
	| sample image | <img src="/img/02_login_putty_05.png"  width="480" title="putty:login info" > |
	| hostname | *as.abci.ai* |

    Click [Open] and enter your abci account and passphrase. if you succeed login, the following screen displayed.

<div align="center">
<img src="/img/02_login_putty_07.png" width="540" title="putty:login as success" >
</div>

!!! warning
    Be sure to SSH session will be disconnected if you press enter any key.

#### 2.2.3.3. login to interactive node

*   Specify a private key file

    Launch new PuTTY, and enter your authentication information same as [access server](#putty:ssh-auth-as).

*   Open session to interactive node with PuTTY

    Click [Session], enter following information to login an interactive server.

	| item | vlue |
	|:--|:--|
	| sample image | <img src="/img/02_login_putty_08.png"  width="480" title="putty:login es" > |
	| host name | localhost |
	| port | port number which use SSH tunnel  ex)11022) |

    Click [Open] and enter your abci account and passphrase. if you succeed login, the following screen displayed.

<div align="center">
<img src="/img/02_login_putty_09.png" width="540" title="putty:login es success" >
</div>


## 2.3. File Transfer to Interactive Node

When you transfer files between your PC and the ABCI system, make an SSH portforwarding/tunneling and use the `scp` (`sftp`) command.

```
yourpc$ scp -P 10022 local-file username@localhost:remote-dir
Enter passphrase for key ：++++++++    <- Enter passphrase
    
local-file    100% |***********************|  file-size  transfer-time
```

## 2.4. Change Password

The user accounts of the ABCI system are managed by the LDAP.
You do not need your password to login via SSH,
but you will need your password when you use the User Portal and change the login shell.
To change your password, use the `passwd` command.

```
[username@es1 ~]$ passwd
Changing password for user username.
Current Password: <- Enter the current password.
New password: <- Enter the new password.
Retype new password: <- Enter the new password again.
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
```

!!! warning
    Password policies are as follows:

    - Specify a character string with more than 15 characters arranged randomly. For example, words in Linux dictionary can not be used. We recommend generating it automatically by using password creation software.
    - Should contain all character types of lower-case letters, upper-case letters, numeric characters, and special characters.
    - Do not contain multi-byte characters.

## 2.5. Login Shell

GNU bash is the login shell be default on the ABCI system.
The tcsh and zsh are available as a login shell.
To change the login shell, use the `chsh` command.
The change become valid from the next login.
It will take 10 minutes to update the login shell.

```
$ chsh  [option]  <new_shell>
```

| Option | Description |
|:--|:--|
| -l | Display the list of available shells. |
| -s *new_shell*| Change the login shell. |

Example) Change the current login shell into tcsh

```
[username@es1 ~]$ chsh -s /bin/tcsh
Password for username@ABCI.LOCAL:     <- Enter password
```

When you login to the ABCI system, user environment is automatically set. If you need to customize environment variables such as `PATH` or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, edit a user configuration file in the following table.

| Login shell | User configuration file |
|:-|:-|
| bash  |  $HOME/.bash_profile |
| tcsh  |  $HOME/.cshrc |
| zsh   |  $HOME/.zshrc |

!!! warning
    Make sure to add a new path at the end of `PATH`. If you add the new path to the beginning, you may not use the system properly.

The original user configuration files (templates) are stored in /etc/skel.

## 2.6. Check ABCI Point

To display ABCI point usage and limitation, use the `show_point` command.
When your ABCI point usage ratio will reach 100%, a new job cannot be submitted and queued jobs will become error state at the beginning. (Any running jobs are not affected.)

Example) Display ABCI point information.

```
[username@es1 ~]$ show_point
Group               Disk                    Used           Point   Used%
grpname                5             12,345.6789         100,000      12
  `- username          -                  0.1234               -       0
```

| Item | Description |
|:--|:--|
| Group | ABCI group name |
| Disk  | Disk assignment (TB) |
| Used  | ABCI point usage |
| Point | ABCI point limit |
| Used% | ABCI point usage ratio |

## 2.7. Check Disk Information

To display your disk usage and quota about home area and group area,
use the `show_quota` command

Example) Display disk information.

```
[username@es1 ~]$ show_quota      ←
Disk quotas for user username
  Directory                     used(GB)       limit(GB)          nfiles
  /home                              100             200           1,234

Disk quotas for ABCI group grpname
  Directory                     used(GB)       limit(GB)          nfiles
  /groups1/grpname                 1,024            2048         123,456
```


| Item  | Description |
|:-|:-|
| Directory | Assignment directory |
| used(GB)  | Disk usage |
| limit(GB) | Disk quota limit |
| nfiles    | Number of files |
