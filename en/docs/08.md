# 8. Use MPI

## 8.1. Open MPI

[Open MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) is available on the ABCI System.
To use this library, set up user environment by the `module` command.
If you set up with the `module` command in interactive node, environment variables for compilation are set automatically.
If you set up with the `module` command in compute node, environment variables for compilation and execution are set automatically.

Example) Setting command for Open MPI

```
[username@es1 ~]$ module load openmpi
```

## 8.2. MVAPICH2-GDR

[MVAPICH2-GDR](http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/) is available on the ABCI System.
To use this library, set up user environment by the `module` command.
If you set up with the `module` command in interactive node, environment variables for compilation are set automatically.
If you set up with the `module` command in compute node, environment variables for compilation and execution are set automatically.

Example) Setting command for MVAPICH2-GDR

```
[username@es1 ~]$ module load mvapich/mvapich2-gdr
```

## 8.3. MVAPICH

[MVAPICH2](http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/) is available on the ABCI System.
To use this library, set up user environment by the `module` command.
If you set up with the `module` command in interactive node, environment variables for compilation are set automatically.
If you set up with the `module` command in compute node, environment variables for compilation and execution are set automatically.

Example) Setting command for MVAPICH

```
[username@es1 ~]$ module load mvapich/mvapich2
```

## 8.4. Other MPI library

[Intel MPI](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mpi-library) is available for ABCI System.
To use this library, set up user environment by the `module` command.
If you set up with the `module` command in interactive node, environment variables for compilation are set automatically.
If you set up with the `module` command in compute node, environment variables for compilation and execution are set automatically.

Example) Setting command for Intel MPI

```
[username@es1 ~]$ module load intel-mpi
```
