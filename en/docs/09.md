# 9. Linux Containers

## 9.1. Singularity {#singularity}

[Singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/singularity/) is available on the ABCI System.
To use Singularity, set up user environment by the `module` command.

```
[username@g0001~]$ module load singularity/2.6.1
```

More comprehensive user guide for Singularity will be found: [User Guide &mdash; Singularity container 2.6 documentation](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/2.6/user-guide/).

### 9.1.1. Running a container with Singularity {#running-a-container-with-singularity}

When you use Singularity, you need to start Singularity container using `singularity run` command in job script.
The container image is downloaded at first startup and cached in home area.
The second and subsequent times startup is faster by using cached data.

Example) Execution of Singularity

The following sample is execution of Singularity using caffe2 container image published in Docker Hub.
`python sample.py` is executed on Singularity container started by `singularity run` command.

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qrsh -l rt_F=1
[username@g0001~]$ module load singularity/2.6.1
[username@g0001~]$ singularity run --nv docker://caffe2ai/caffe2:latest
Docker image path: index.docker.io/caffe2ai/caffe2:latest
Cache folder set to /fs3/home/username/.singularity/docker
Creating container runtime...
...
[username@g0001~]$ python sample.py
True
```

### 9.1.2. Create a Singularity image {#create-a-singularity-image}

Singularity container image can be stored as a file.
On ABCI system, you cannot build a container image from the recipe.
To use your custom container image, you adapt your own server environment to the ABCI environment (the version of singularity, framework, and mpi), build a container image on it,
and then move the container image to ABCI system.

Example) Create a Singularity image file

```
[username@es1 ~]$ module load singularity/2.6.1
[username@es1 ~]$ singularity pull --name caffe2.img docker://caffe2ai/caffe2:latest
Docker image path: index.docker.io/caffe2ai/caffe2:latest
Cache folder set to /fs3/home/username/.singularity/docker
...
[username@es1 ~]$ ls caffe2.img
caffe2.img
```

Example) Start a container using Singularity image file

```
[username@es1 ~]$ module load singularity/2.6.1
[username@es1 ~]$ singularity run ./caffe2.img
```

## 9.2. Docker {#docker}

In the ABCI System, job can be executed on Docker container.
When you use Docker, you need to set up user environment by the `module` command and specify `-l docker` option and `-l docker_image` option at job submission.


| option | description |
|:--|:--|
| -l docker | job is executed on Docker container |
| -l docker_images | specify using Docker image |

The available Docker image can be referred by `show_docker_images` command.

```
[username@es1 ~]$ show_docker_images
REPOSITORY                TAG             IMAGE ID     CREATED       SIZE
jcm:5000/dhub/ubuntu      latest          113a43faa138 3 weeks ago   81.2MB
```

!!! warning
    In ABCI System, User can be used only provided Docker image in the system.

Example) job script using Docker

The following job script executes `python3 ./test.py` on Docker container.

```
[username@es1 ~]$ cat run.sh
#!/bin/sh
#$-cwd
#$-j y
#$-l rt_F=1
#$-l docker=1
#$-l docker_images="*jcm:5000/dhub/ubuntu*"

python3 ./sample.py
```

Example) Submission of job script using Docker

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qsub run.sh
Your job 12345 ("run.sh") has been submitted
```
